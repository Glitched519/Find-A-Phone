This program only runs in Processing 3.x. If you don't have Processing, download it at https://processing.org/download/. 
**This program requires the G4P library and the G4P GUI Builder Tool. To install them, go to Tools -> Add Tool... -> then this will open up the Contribution Manager window. Go into the Tools tab, select G4P GUI Builder, and click install. Then go into the Libraries tab, select G4P, and click install.**
*G4P GUI Builder is a graphic design tool for creating user interfaces with G4P. G4P provides a set of 2D GUI controls and multiple window support.*

### Building the Application
If you want to build the application, go to File -> Export Application (Ctrl+Shift+E). Select the OS you want to build it for.  _Linux users, please note you can choose the option to **Embed Java for Linux (64-bit)** if you don't have Java 8 installed. However, the application will weigh a few hundred MB more._
After building the application, the application won't run until you copy the **CSV** and **images** into the directory where the executable is at.

### Support
If you have any questions or issues, please let me know in the Issues tab, and I'll try to find a solution to them as soon as possible.
